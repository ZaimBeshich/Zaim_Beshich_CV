## About

With over four years of commercial experience, I have developed strong skills as a software engineer. Specialising in cross-platform development with React and React Native, I build stable and scalable applications, from single screen to high-load systems. I have participated in the full development cycle of applications, ensuring comprehensive solutions.  

Competence in debugging, testing, and cross-browser development, my approach is business-driven, ensuring solutions align with strategic goals.  

I have successfully worked mobile development teams of various sizes, ranging from 4 to 40 members, focusing on collaboration and timely project delivery. Additionally, I have led and mentored colleagues, helping them grow and improve their skills. Thriving in team environments, I believe teamwork is key to innovative problem-solving and achieving exceptional results.
